The previous AI engineer meticulously developed the Master Seal application, transitioning it from an MVP to a robust state by addressing numerous bugs and implementing significant new features. Key achievements include resolving a complex unit conversion and material compatibility bug, fixing invoice editing issues (like non-editable fields and invoice disappearance post-save), and implementing a sophisticated pricing system with automatic calculations. The trajectory showcases an iterative development process, frequently incorporating user feedback to refine features like multi-material selection in compatibility checks, ensuring precise inventory deduction logic, and enhancing work order details. The engineer also tackled critical treasury and invoice display bugs, demonstrating strong debugging capabilities. The journey involved continuous backend and frontend modifications, highlighting adaptability and a deep understanding of the codebase.

<product_requirements>
The Master Seal application is an integrated system for an oil seal manufacturing and supply company. It manages sales, inventory (Jard), production, financials, and user access. Core functionalities include recording customer orders, managing raw material deduction, various invoicing options (immediate/deferred), discount application, handling local products with specific sizing, and editable invoice titles. Inventory features stock management, availability checks, automatic deduction, and advanced search with Excel import/export. Financials cover accounts payable, customer ledgers, revenues/expenses, and a treasury system. Work orders are generated from invoices. The UI supports full Arabic and RTL, built with Tailwind CSS. The backend uses FastAPI, and data is stored in MongoDB, with UUIDs for identifiers. Recent developments focused on unit conversion, compatibility checks, and robust data consistency across various modules.

        -   : Added adaptive tolerance, scoring, and material_type filtering. Refined filtering to exclude materials leaving <15mm.
        -   : Fixed discount calculation logic to run independently of item updates.
        -   : Fixed to prevent double counting invoice amounts from invoices and treasury.
        -   New  Pydantic model and CRUD APIs ().
        -   : New API for clearing treasury data.
        -   Inventory deduction logic: Updated to deduct from  using  and . Fixed multiple instances of double deduction and material search priority ( +  +  first). Enhanced work order creation to store  for multi-material tracking and .
        -    Model: Added  and .
        -   Added API for .

        -   Invoice creation: Added  state to prevent double-clicks on the Create Invoice button.
        -    page: Fixed filter logic to exclude non-deferred invoices with . Added search filter and customer total display.
        -   Dual measurement input: Implemented two input fields (mm/inch) with auto-conversion for , , , . Removed separate unit selection field. Updated  state, reset, and  logic.
        -   New  page component: Added to navigation, permissions, and main  logic.
        -   Sales page: Added  state and dropdown. Integrated  for automatic pricing during material selection. Added a ملاحظات (notes) field to the product addition form.
        -    page: Added  function and مسح الخزينة button (conditional for 'Elsawy' user).
        -   Multi-material selection: Implemented UI to allow selecting multiple materials from a single compatibility check result, with quantity input for each. Updated  state and  function. Fixed bug where select button disappeared for other materials. Updated work order display for multi-material .
        -   Planned UI for invoice payment method conversion and invoice cancellation.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Documents problem statements, testing outcomes, and AI agent communications.
    -   **Changes Made**: Regularly updated to track bug fixes and feature implementations, including unit conversion, material type filtering, invoice editing, treasury bugs, inventory deduction, pricing, and multi-material selection.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the frontend UI for converting invoice payment methods.
-   Implement the frontend UI for invoice cancellation.
-   Address the bug where depleted materials might still appear as available in the compatibility check or for selection within the same invoice transaction.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on a set of critical bug fixes and enhancements reported by the user. These included:
1.  **Enhanced Compatibility Check**: Refined the backend logic in  to prevent materials from appearing in the compatibility check if deducting from them would leave less than 15mm of material (Chat Message 466).
2.  **Notes in Sales**: Added a ملاحظات (notes) field to the product addition form in  and updated the  model in  to store these notes (Chat Message 468, 470).
3.  **Deferred Page Filter and Totals**: Implemented a search filter (by customer, invoice number, or title) and displayed aggregate totals (total amount, invoice count) for each customer in the Deferred page () (Chat Message 472-482).

The engineer successfully implemented and verified these three items, as summarized in Chat Message 485. Immediately following this, the user provided a simple اكمل (continue) command (Chat Message 486), and the engineer started working on the next two pending tasks:
4.  **Change Invoice Payment Method**: An API endpoint () has been added to  (Chat Message 488).
5.  **Invoice Cancellation**: The implementation for this feature, which involves returning materials to inventory and adjusting treasury balance, and its corresponding frontend UI, is planned to be developed next (Chat Message 489).

The work paused at the point of adding the frontend UI for both payment method conversion and invoice cancellation.
