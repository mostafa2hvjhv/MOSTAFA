The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the Master Seal application from an MVP to a feature-rich system. The development trajectory illustrates an iterative process of implementing complex Arabic-specific product requirements, including RTL support and intricate business logic for oil seal manufacturing. Key functionalities added or refined include a comprehensive treasury system, automated daily work orders, and a robust invoice discount mechanism. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging capabilities, addressing persistent issues like frontend state synchronization and backend data persistence. The work involved extensive modifications to both the FastAPI backend and React frontend, focusing on expanding core modules and meticulously resolving reported bugs, such as initial JSX syntax errors and issues within the user management module. The most recent efforts have concentrated on further refining inventory logic, local product handling, invoice editing, and resolving a recurring treasury issue, indicating a continuous cycle of enhancement and stabilization.

<product_requirements>
The Master Seal application is a comprehensive management system for an oil seal manufacturing and supply company. It manages sales, inventory, production, expenses, revenues, and user settings.
Key features include:
*   **Sales:** Recording customer orders, linking to inventory for raw material deduction, immediate/deferred invoicing, multiple products per invoice, and a discount field (fixed/percentage). It now supports local products with separate size and type fields, linked to suppliers. Invoice creation now includes an editable title field.
*   **Inventory (Jard):** A new dedicated section for raw material stock management, tracking by number of pieces instead of height. It performs availability checks and automatic deduction upon adding raw materials, with error messages if stock is insufficient. Minimum stock limit is 2 pieces, no maximum.
*   **Accounts Payable (Deferred Invoices):** Tracks unpaid invoices, customer ledgers, payment reminders, and partial/full payments.
*   **Revenues & Expenses:** Recording income/expenses, categorization, and generating financial reports.
*   **Work Order (امر شغل):** Selecting multiple invoices for work orders, displaying material and unit codes, and tracking manufacturing status. Enhanced with automatic daily work order creation and a supervisor name field.
*   **Treasury:** Manages 6 financial accounts, tracks automatic transactions from invoices/expenses, allows manual entries and transfers. The 'Yad Elsawy' account can be cleared by admin 'Elsawy'. A recurring issue with deferred payments not correctly affecting the treasury is being addressed.
*   **User Management:** Multiple user roles with configurable permissions. Initially had issues with edits not persisting and new user registration, which have been fixed. Dashboard access is restricted to 'Elsawy' only.
*   **Local Page:** A new section for managing suppliers (name, phone, address), local products (name, buy/sell price per supplier), recording purchases, tracking supplier accounts, and a payment system linked to the Treasury for settlement.
*   **Invoices (General):** Invoices are now visible to all users. A new feature has been added to allow editing saved invoices, including the ability to modify invoice items.
*   **Search/Filtering:** General search filtering has been requested for Suppliers, Inventory, Jard, Expenses, and Treasury pages.
*   **Excel Integration:** Future request to import/export raw materials and Jard data via Excel sheets.
*   **Technical Details:** Full Arabic UI with RTL support, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, FastAPI APIs, direct invoice printing (now unified, improved with company logo/address), automatic inventory/payment updates, and various payment methods. UUIDs are used for IDs.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of rectifying issues that arose from the most recent round of feature implementations and bug fixes. The work immediately before this summary involved addressing the user's latest feedback:
1.  **Jard System Refinement:** The backend models (, ) and corresponding APIs in  were updated to track raw material inventory by  (number of pieces) instead of , and the  field was removed, with a minimum threshold of 2 pieces. The frontend  (Jard) component in  was also updated to reflect these changes in its UI, input fields, and display tables.
2.  **Local Product Name Split:** The  model in  was modified to split the  field into  and . The Sales page's Add Product section in  was updated to include separate input fields for these new attributes, and the  function was adjusted to send this segmented data.
3.  **Invoice Item Editing:** Functionality was added to the  in  to allow users to modify individual items within a saved invoice.
4.  **Treasury & Deferred Payment Fix Re-attempt:** The issue where deferred payments were not correctly reflected in the Treasury was re-investigated. The previous fix involved adding logic to the  and  APIs in  to correctly handle Treasury transactions based on payment method ( vs. others). A specific fix was applied to correct  enum comparison logic.

The last action recorded () was اكتشفت المشاكل في التحسينات. دعني أصلحها بسرعة (Discovered problems in improvements. Let me fix them quickly), indicating that the features listed above were implemented but are currently exhibiting bugs that the engineer is actively trying to resolve. Therefore, the product state reflects these changes, but they are not yet fully functional or stable.
