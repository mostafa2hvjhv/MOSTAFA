<current_work>
The AI engineer has completed a comprehensive set of enhancements and bug fixes for the Master Seal application, bringing it to a production-ready state. The work immediately preceding this summary involved addressing several critical areas:

1.  **Local Product Display Correction:** The display of local products in invoices and work orders was refined to correctly show  and  instead of static OR-100 values, ensuring accurate representation of the product details for the user.
2.  **Imperial to Metric Conversion:** For compatibility checks, a new feature was implemented to automatically convert imperial measurements (inches) to millimeters (by multiplying by 25.4) when the user selects 'inches' as the unit of measurement, ensuring consistent data handling in the backend. This also involved updating the  logic in the frontend to save values in millimeters.
3.  **Expanded CRUD Operations:** Full edit and delete functionalities were added for:
    *   Items within an invoice during its creation (frontend).
    *   Raw materials and finished products in the inventory section (frontend and backend PUT endpoints).
    *   Suppliers and local products in the Local management section (frontend and leveraging existing backend PUT/DELETE endpoints).
4.  **UI/UX Overhaul:** A significant visual update was applied, transforming the application's layout. This included implementing a new, aesthetically pleasing vertical sidebar navigation on the right (RTL compliant), and redesigning the Dashboard and Login pages for a more modern and consistent look.
5.  **Excel Import Bug Fix:** A critical bug where raw materials imported via Excel were not appearing in the inventory was diagnosed and resolved. The fix involved adding the Excel import functionality to the frontend's inventory section and addressing backend issues, including potential data corruption, ensuring imported data is correctly displayed.

All these implemented features and bug fixes have been thoroughly tested, and the system is confirmed to be fully functional and stable.
