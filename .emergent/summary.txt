The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Master Seal application from conception to a functional MVP, implementing a full-stack solution using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. The initial phase focused on core modules and expanding functionality according to detailed Arabic product requirements, including RTL support and complex business logic for oil seal manufacturing.

The development trajectory highlights a continuous cycle of feature implementation, bug identification, and meticulous resolution. Key challenges addressed included persistent delete functionalities (frontend state vs. backend persistence), ensuring correct data display in work orders (especially unit codes and material details), implementing new features like daily automatic work orders, a comprehensive treasury system with financial transactions, and a robust invoice discount mechanism. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, iteratively refining the application based on user feedback and in-depth code analysis for both frontend and backend components. Current work focuses on resolving a frontend rendering error in the sales module.

<product_requirements>
The Master Seal application is a comprehensive management system for an oil seal manufacturing and supply company, designed to manage sales, inventory, production, expenses, revenues, and detailed settings. Key features include:

*   **Sales:** Recording customer orders, linking to inventory for raw material deduction based on oil seal dimensions (inner/outer/height), issuing immediate/deferred invoices, and generating reports. Supports multiple products per invoice. A recent addition is a discount field (fixed or percentage) on invoices.
*   **Inventory:** Managing raw materials (cylindrical stock by dimensions, material type) with low-stock alerts, and finished goods inventory.
*   **Accounts Payable (Deferred Invoices):** Tracking unpaid invoices, customer ledgers, payment reminders, and partial/full payments.
*   **Revenues & Expenses:** Recording income/expenses, categorization, and generating financial reports (monthly, weekly, daily profit/loss).
*   **Work Order (امر شغل):** Selecting multiple invoices for a single work order, displaying used material and unit codes, and tracking manufacturing status. Recently enhanced with an automatic daily work order creation and a supervisor name field.
*   **Treasury:** A newly implemented module managing 6 financial accounts (Cash, Vodafone Cash Elsawy, Vodafone Cash Wael, Deferred, InstaPay, and 'Yad Elsawy'). It tracks automatic transactions from invoices/expenses, allows manual income/expense entries, and facilitates transfers between accounts. The 'Yad Elsawy' account can be zeroed only by the admin user 'Elsawy'.
*   **User Management:** Multiple user roles (admin, sub) with configurable permissions.
*   **Reporting:** Various sales, inventory, expense, and profit/loss reports.
*   **Technical Details:** Full Arabic UI with RTL support, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, FastAPI APIs, direct invoice printing (now unified and improved with company logo and updated address), automatic inventory/payment updates, and various payment methods. The compatibility check feature ensures correct material usage.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This file encapsulates the entire FastAPI backend, defining API endpoints, handling business logic, and interacting with MongoDB. It manages data models for all application modules.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   **Extensive CRUD operations** for all entities (sales, inventory, customers, expenses, revenues, invoices, work orders, users, finished products, treasury transactions).
        *   **Added clear all APIs** for various modules (inventory, expenses, invoices, work orders) and individual  APIs for customers, payments, work orders, users, and finished products.
        *   **Refined  and  models**:  now includes , , , . Crucially,  now includes  (a dictionary) to persist full raw material information.
        *   **Work Order Logic**: Modified to support automatic daily work order creation, including  and  fields in the  model.
        *   **Treasury APIs**: Introduced  model and corresponding APIs (, , , ).
        *   **Payment Methods**: Updated  enum to include .
        *   **Compatibility Check**: Logic enhanced with better validation.
        *   **Error Handling**: Improvements for MongoDB ObjectId serialization and data parsing.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the main React component managing the application's routing, user authentication, data fetching from backend APIs, and rendering of UI components for all modules.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has been heavily modified to support new features and bug fixes.
        *   **Authentication & Navigation**: Implemented login, user context, and dynamic navigation based on user roles.
        *   **Module Components**: Developed and integrated all module-specific components (Dashboard, Sales, Inventory, Accounts Payable, Expenses, Revenues, Invoices, Work Orders, User Management, and the newly added Treasury).
        *   **API Integration**: Utilizes  for all backend interactions.
        *   **State Management**: Manages complex form inputs, data display, and UI interactions (tables, modals, dynamic buttons).
        *   **Delete Functionality**: Updated  functions and individual  functions to correctly call backend APIs and refresh state, fixing persistence issues.  added for user list refresh.
        *   **Work Order Display & Print**: Corrected unit code display logic to show raw material details (e.g., ) instead of finished seal dimensions, and added logic for Finished Goods Inventory.  now passed to invoices correctly for persistence.
        *   **Invoice Printing**: Unified  function across Sales and Invoices pages, adding company logo (base64 encoded), updated address, and improved font sizes.
        *   **Daily Work Order**: Added input for  in sales form, updated logic to send it to the backend.
        *   **Treasury Module**: Integrated the new Treasury component, linking its manual transactions and transfers to new backend APIs. Added the 'Yad Elsawy' account and a conditional Clear button visible only to admin.
        *   **Discount Feature**: Added discount type (fixed/percentage) and value inputs to sales form, calculated and displayed discount breakdown, and updated invoice display tables.

<current_work>
The current work focuses on resolving a frontend bug reported by the user: في المبيعات عند الضغط علي اضاغة للفاتورة يعطي هذا الرساله (In sales, when clicking 'add to invoice', an error message appears). The AI engineer has identified that the issue is likely due to incorrect JSX syntax, specifically using  as a string instead of an object. The last action was to search for the specific problematic line () within  to begin the fix. The goal is to correct this syntax error to ensure the sales form's Add to Invoice functionality works without visual or functional errors.
