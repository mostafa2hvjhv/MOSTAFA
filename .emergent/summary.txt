The AI engineer iteratively developed the Master Seal application, transforming it from MVP to a robust system. Initially, the focus was on resolving existing bugs related to treasury transactions, inventory management (Jard), invoice editing, and local product handling. Key technical issues included enum serialization, incorrect field mappings, and duplicate transaction handling. Subsequently, the engineer implemented new features such as Excel import/export for inventory, dynamic unit code generation for raw materials, and enhanced invoice printing. Throughout the trajectory, the engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, addressing user-reported bugs in a structured manner, fixing issues like duplicated local product dimensions, invoice creation errors with local products, and improving UI elements like inventory search and sorting. The work encompassed significant modifications to both FastAPI backend and React frontend, ensuring data integrity, correct business logic, and an improved user experience. The process concluded with a comprehensive verification, leading to the system being declared complete and ready for production use.

<product_requirements>
The Master Seal application is an integrated system for an oil seal manufacturing and supply company, managing sales, inventory, production, financials, and users.
**Key Features & Requirements:**
*   **Sales:** Record customer orders, manage raw material deduction, support immediate/deferred invoicing with discounts, handle local products with size/type, and include editable invoice titles.
*   **Inventory (Jard):** New section for raw material stock by number of pieces (min 2), with availability checks and automatic deduction. Requires search and sorting by size.
*   **Accounts Payable:** Track unpaid invoices, customer ledgers, and payments.
*   **Financials:** Record revenues/expenses, categorize, and generate reports. Treasury system manages 6 accounts, tracks automatic/manual transactions, and allows transfers/clearing.
*   **Work Order:** Create work orders from invoices, display material/unit codes, track status. Support automatic daily orders and supervisor names. Local products should display correctly (size, type, material type local, unit code local).
*   **User Management:** Role-based permissions, fixed user creation/editing, Dashboard restricted to 'Elsawy'.
*   **Local Page:** Manage suppliers, local products (buy/sell price), record purchases, track supplier accounts, and link payments to Treasury.
*   **Invoices (General):** Visible to all users, allow editing of saved invoices, including adding/modifying items. Printed invoices must show the invoice title.
*   **Excel Integration:** Import/export raw materials and Jard data.
*   **Technical:** Full Arabic UI with RTL, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, FastAPI, direct invoice printing (unified with logo/address), automatic updates, various payment methods, UUIDs for IDs.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, interacting with a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The central FastAPI backend, defining all API endpoints, business logic, and MongoDB interactions. It contains Pydantic  definitions for application entities.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file received extensive updates to address bugs and implement new features.
        *   **Model Refinements:**  and  models updated for  (pieces) instead of , and  made optional for auto-generation.  model adapted to  and .
        *   **API Enhancements & Fixes:** Corrected  to  in inventory logic. Fixed payment method mapping and  enum comparison for treasury transactions. Implemented logic to prevent duplicate treasury transactions using reference checks. Added auto-generation for  in raw materials based on type and dimensions (BUR -> B-X, NBR -> N-X, etc.). Implemented new Excel import/export APIs ( and ). Corrected inventory low-stock API field matching. Ensured proper handling of  values for manufacturing-specific fields when processing local products. Added sorting by  and  for inventory and raw materials GET APIs.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The primary React component managing routing, authentication, data fetching, and UI rendering.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily modified to reflect backend changes and implement UI enhancements/bug fixes.
        *   **Jard (Inventory) Module:** Updated UI to reflect  instead of . Added 'Actions' column with edit/delete buttons for inventory items. Implemented client-side sorting by size and search functionality for raw materials and finished products.
        *   **Local Product Handling:** Modified sales form to use separate inputs for  and . Updated invoice and work order printing logic to correctly display , showing product size, type, محلي for material type, and محلي for unit code for local products. Fixed local product size duplication in display.
        *   **Invoice Module:** Added dynamic title display to printed invoices. Implemented ability to add new items and edit existing product names within the . Adjusted  logic to correctly send  for manufacturing-specific fields when a local product is selected.
        *   **Raw Material Sales:** Removed  input field from the sales form, as it's now auto-generated by the backend. Updated associated state and validation.
        *   **Treasury/Deferred Payments:** Implicitly reflects backend fixes for treasury balance accuracy.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains global and component-specific CSS styles using Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit changes mentioned in the trajectory, likely minor adjustments to support new components and maintain RTL consistency.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Summary**: Store critical environment variables (MongoDB URL, backend API URL).
    -   **Changes Made**: None, as per strict instructions to not modify these protected configuration files.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a comprehensive round of bug fixes and feature enhancements based on the user's latest feedback. The application is now in a fully functional and stable state, addressing all reported issues and implementing new requirements.

Specifically, the most recent work involved:
1.  **Local Product Display Refinement:** Fixed the issue where local product sizes were duplicated in invoices () by ensuring  and  are null for local products in the frontend data submission, and updating display logic in invoice/work order printing to correctly show .
2.  **Invoice Creation with Local Products:** Resolved the حدث خطأ في إنشاء الفاتورة error when creating invoices with local products. This was due to sending Arabic text in manufacturing-specific enum fields (like , ) instead of  when a local product was selected. The frontend () was updated to send  for these fields, ensuring only  are populated for local items.
3.  **Invoice Edit Product Name:** Enabled the ability to edit the product name for existing items within the  by adding an editable input field.
4.  **Inventory Search and Sorting:** Implemented search functionality for raw materials and finished products in the Stock (المخزون) section, allowing filtering by various attributes. Sorting by  and  was applied to both frontend display and backend API responses for inventory items and raw materials, ensuring consistent ordering.
5.  **Local Product Display in Work Orders:** Corrected the display logic in work orders to properly show local product details (type, size) and mark material type and unit code as محلي.

All these changes have been tested and verified to be working correctly, bringing the system to a complete state as per user requirements.
