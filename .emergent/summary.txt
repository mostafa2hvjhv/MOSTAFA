The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Master Seal application to a production-ready state, addressing critical bugs and implementing new features. The trajectory details the resolution of a unit conversion bug where inch measurements, when converted to millimeters, failed to find compatible materials due to a strict backend algorithm and empty database. The engineer introduced adaptive tolerance and a scoring system in  and added test data, verifying the fix. Subsequently, the user reported two new issues: incorrect filtering by material type in compatibility checks and problems with invoice editing. The material type filtering issue was promptly resolved by updating the  model and logic in  and . The AI is currently investigating the invoice editing issues, specifically why the product type field is not editable and why invoices disappear after saving edits, having identified static text display as a potential cause for the former.

<product_requirements>
The Master Seal application is a comprehensive system for an oil seal manufacturing and supply company, designed to manage core business operations. Its primary goal is to provide an integrated solution for sales, inventory (Jard), production, financials, and user management. Key features include recording customer orders, managing raw material deduction, invoicing (immediate/deferred), discount application, handling local products with specific size/type, and editable invoice titles. Inventory management covers stock by pieces, availability checks, automatic deduction, and advanced search/sorting with Excel import/export. Financials track accounts payable, customer ledgers, revenues/expenses, and a treasury system. Work orders are created from invoices. The system supports a full Arabic UI with RTL, uses Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, FastAPI, and UUIDs for identifiers. The previous development phases focused on ensuring data consistency, improving UI/UX, expanding CRUD operations, and implementing unit conversion for compatibility checks.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture comprising a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, which interacts with a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This file serves as the core of the FastAPI backend, handling all API endpoints, business logic, and interactions with the MongoDB database. It also defines Pydantic  schemas for application entities.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   ** Model**: Modified to include  as an optional field, enabling filtering of compatible materials by type.
        -   ****: Updated to incorporate an adaptive 10% tolerance for inner/outer diameter and height measurements, and a compatibility scoring system for ranking materials. It also now filters materials based on the  provided in the request.
        -   ****: Examined during the investigation of invoice editing issues, but no direct modifications were made in the provided trajectory.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component responsible for managing application routing, user authentication, data fetching, and rendering the user interface.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   ** function**: Modified to correctly send the selected  to the backend when invoking the compatibility check API, ensuring that filtering by material type functions as expected from the UI.
        -   **Invoice Editing UI**: Investigated for two reported issues: the product type field not being editable within the invoice edit modal, and all invoices disappearing after saving edits. It was observed that manufactured products'  fields are rendered as static, non-editable text. Functions like  and  were examined in this context.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This file acts as a comprehensive log, documenting user problem statements, testing outcomes, and the AI agent's communications throughout the development process.
    -   **Changes Made**: Regularly updated to track the diagnosis, iterative fixes, and successful resolution of the unit conversion bug. It also documents the new bug reports concerning material type filtering and invoice editing, alongside the successful resolution of the material type filtering issue.

The AI engineer recently completed fixing a critical unit conversion bug. When users selected inches as the unit for inner and outer diameters, the compatibility check failed to find suitable materials, despite correct mathematical conversion. The root cause was a strict compatibility algorithm in  and a lack of appropriately sized materials in the database. The solution involved implementing an adaptive 10% tolerance and a scoring system in the  endpoint of , along with adding test data. This fix was thoroughly verified via backend  tests and frontend testing.

Following this, the user reported two new issues. The first, compatibility check with material type not filtering correctly, was resolved by updating the  Pydantic model in  to include , modifying the backend's  logic to filter by this type, and updating  to send the  during the compatibility API call. This fix has been verified.

The AI is currently working on the second reported issue: invoice editing problems. This involves two parts:
1.  The product type field is not editable when modifying an invoice.
2.  All invoices disappear from the list after saving an edited invoice.
The AI has begun investigating , identifying that for manufactured products, the  is currently rendered as static, non-editable text (lines 4963-4979). The  and  functions are also under scrutiny for the disappearing invoices bug.
